# reddit-account-migrator

## Features (WIP)

- Migrate the following between accounts:
  - Subscriptions
  - Upvotes
  - Downvotes
  - Saved content
  - Hidden content
  - ~~Gildings~~
  - ~~Gilded items~~
  - Friends (using new account, sends a request to each friend from old account)
  - Blocked users
  - Preferences
  
## Nice to have

- Command line usage:
  - Migrate all of the above by default, but allow for picking specific items through options
  - Verbose mode: list result of each operation, etc.
  - Get old user's data and save to disk
  - Load old user's data from disk and apply to new user
